# Image-Processing-with-SLT-Mapping

Researching novel methods in image processing for AI Vision tasks.
Researching Vision AI models and Architectures for better performing models can be challenging. Nowadays, a big part for better performance models relies on suppling better training data, such data in specific fields that we've lack in.

In order to tackle such an issue, I'm offering some image processing methods\approaches mainly for transforming\comparing image\data probability distributions.
Such image processing approaches can be thought of as a type of FIR (Finite Impulse Response) Filter.
As such, these modules could be used for AI vision model tuning via image data processing\pre-processing.

This project includes,

* Minkowski P Distance
* Arithmetic Euclidean Distance
* Image Slice Matrixes
* Histogram Matching
* Image Slicing
* SLT Tone Mapping Transformation
* Image Tone Mapping
* Contrast Enhancement
* etc.

In this code, I make a humble image processing research using and comparing differente images via the above.
The code walks through the different methods in a novel way.
